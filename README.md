# Traffic-Accident-Data-Analysis-for-the-Year-2022-Using-SQL
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data for the year 2022 using SQL. The analysis includes retrieving accident information and classifying incidents based on various criteria such as accident type (severe, fatal, minor), type of vehicle involved, lighting conditions, location (urban or rural), and other influencing factors. The project also evaluates monthly accident trends, compares data between 2022 and 2021, and analyzes the impact of these factors on injuries and fatalities.

Project Objectives:
Analyze traffic accidents in terms of number and types based on different criteria.
Identify high-risk areas with the highest accident rates.
Assess the impact of environmental conditions (e.g., lighting) on accidents.
Provide accurate statistics to support informed decision-making for road safety improvements.
Steps Followed:
Extract data from the traffic accident database.
Classify accidents by year, severity (fatal, severe, minor), and other relevant factors.
Compare accident data between 2022 and 2021 to measure changes.
Analyze statistics related to vehicle types, urban and rural locations, and lighting conditions.
Generate reports and recommendations based on the extracted insights.
This project leverages SQL for precise and efficient data extraction and analysis to support road safety initiatives.
